# About the game

Pengo is an arcade game developed by Coreland and published by Sega in 1982. The player controls Pengo, a red penguin that resides in the Antarctic. The game takes place in an overhead maze made of ice blocks, where Pengo crushes blob-like Sno-Bees by sliding blocks into them. The objective is to survive each round by eliminating all Sno-Bees and Sno-Bee eggs, while optionally lining up the three diamond blocks for a large bonus.

At the start of each round, some blocks will flash to indicate they contain eggs. As the player destroys Sno-Bees, new ones will hatch from the eggs to replace them. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees with a single block will award extra points. Pushing against a wall causes it to vibrate and stun nearby Sno-Bees. Walking over a stunned Sno-Bee kills it. Diamond blocks cannot be destroyed and will award the player bonus points if they manage to put them in a line. If the player survives for 2 minutes without losing a life or completing the round, the Sno-Bees will walk to a corner and disappear. If only one Sno-Bee remains, it will walk to a corner and disappear after a short delay. Once all Sno-Bees are gone, the round ends.
