Pengo is an arcade game developed by Coreland and published by Sega in 1982. The player controls Pengo, a red penguin that resides in the Antarctic. The game takes place in an overhead maze made of ice blocks, where Pengo crushes blob-like Sno-Bees by sliding blocks into them. The objective is to survive each round by eliminating all Sno-Bees and Sno-Bee eggs, while optionally lining up the three diamond blocks for a large bonus.

#### Controls
Press Space to start the game. Use W, A, S, D to move the player and use Space to push blocks and walls. In order to beat the game, you must push the blocks of the maze into the Sno-Bees. You can also earn bonus points by aligning the three diamond blocks. If you push a border wall, it will shake and kill any Sno-Bees next to it.

You can activate God Mode by pressing G. This will make you invincible.
